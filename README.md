	- bash command for optimised gfortran compilation .... (what was it!)

	- gnuplot script for quick test plotting

	- upload the most recent version of the f90 script

	- refactor & optimise & make 'publication' ready:
		-- more commentrary, add submodules
		-- look into 'photran' eclipse extension

	- create py wrapper (using f2py), then can combine plotting functionality,  maybe?
